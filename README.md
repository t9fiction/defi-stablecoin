# PKR Stablecoin (PKRS)

**PKRS** is a decentralized stablecoin anchored to the Pakistani Rupee (PKR) and backed by exogenous crypto assets. It leverages an algorithmic stability mechanism to maintain its peg to PKR, providing users with a reliable digital asset for transactions and savings.

## Overview

PKRS aims to combine the stability of traditional fiat currencies with the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). By anchoring the value of PKRS to PKR, users can enjoy a stable digital currency that mitigates the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies.

## Features

- **Anchored to PKR**: PKRS maintains a stable value relative to the Pakistani Rupee.
- **Algorithmic Stability**: The supply of PKRS is adjusted algorithmically to ensure stability.
- **Decentralized**: Fully decentralized, no central authority controls the supply or management of PKRS.
- **Exogenous Collateral**: Backed by well-established crypto assets like wBTC and wETH.

## Stability Mechanism

PKRS utilizes an algorithmic stability mechanism that adjusts the supply of the token based on market demand to maintain its peg to PKR. This decentralized approach ensures that PKRS remains stable without relying on centralized control.

### Minting

- **Algorithmic Minting**: New PKRS tokens are minted algorithmically when the demand increases, ensuring that the price remains pegged to PKR.
- **Collateral Backing**: The minting process is backed by exogenous crypto assets (wBTC, wETH) to ensure the security and stability of PKRS.

## Collateral Assets

PKRS is backed by a basket of exogenous crypto assets, ensuring its stability and security:

- **wBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)**: A tokenized version of Bitcoin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **wETH (Wrapped Ethereum)**: A tokenized version of Ethereum that is compatible with the ERC-20 standard.

These assets provide the necessary collateral to support the value of PKRS.

## Minting and Redemption

- **Minting**: Users can mint new PKRS tokens by locking collateral assets (wBTC, wETH) in the protocol.
- **Redemption**: Users can redeem PKRS tokens for the underlying collateral, ensuring that the value of PKRS remains anchored to PKR.

## Security

The PKRS protocol is built with security in mind, leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and the robust collateral backing of wBTC and wETH. Regular audits and community governance ensure the ongoing security and stability of the protocol.
